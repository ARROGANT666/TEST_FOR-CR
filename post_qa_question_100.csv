3,222,"the monte carlo method, as mentioned, applies some great concepts but it is, clearly, not the fastest, not by a long shot, not by any reasonable measure. also, it all depends on what kind of accuracy you are looking for. the fastest π i know of is the one with the digits hard coded. looking at pi and pi[pdf], there are a lot of formulae.

here is a method that converges quickly — about 14 digits per iteration. pifast, the current fastest application, uses this formula with the fft. i'll just write the formula, since the code is straightforward. this formula was almost found by ramanujan and discovered by chudnovsky. it is actually how he calculated several billion digits of the number — so it isn't a method to disregard. the formula will overflow quickly and, since we are dividing factorials, it would be advantageous then to delay such calculations to remove terms.





where,



below is the brent–salamin algorithm. wikipedia mentions that when a and b are ""close enough"" then (a + b)² / 4t will be an approximation of π. i'm not sure what ""close enough"" means, but from my tests, one iteration got 2 digits, two got 7, and three had 15, of course this is with doubles, so it might have an error based on its representation and the true calculation could be more accurate.

let pi_2 iters =
    let rec loop_ a b t p i =
        if i = 0 then a,b,t,p
        else
            let a_n = (a +. b) /. 2.0 
            and b_n = sqrt (a*.b)
            and p_n = 2.0 *. p in
            let t_n = t -. (p *. (a -. a_n) *. (a -. a_n)) in
            loop_ a_n b_n t_n p_n (i - 1)
    in 
    let a,b,t,p = loop_ (1.0) (1.0 /. (sqrt 2.0)) (1.0/.4.0) (1.0) iters in
    (a +. b) *. (a +. b) /. (4.0 *. t)


lastly, how about some pi golf (800 digits)? 160 characters!

int a=10000,b,c=2800,d,e,f[2801],g;main(){for(;b-c;)f[b++]=a/5;for(;d=0,g=c*2;c-=14,printf(""%.4d"",e+d/a),e=d%a)for(b=c;d+=f[b]*a,f[b]=d%--g,d/=g--,--b;d*=b);}

5,34,"i don't think you have anything to worry about. if system.totalmemory goes down you can relax. it may very well be the os that doesn't reclaim the newly freed memory (in anticipation of the next time flash player will ask for more memory).

try doing something else that is very memory intensive and i'm sure that you'll notice that the memory allocated to flash player will decrease and be used for the other process instead.

as i've understood it, memory management in modern os's isn't intuitive from the perspective of looking at the amounts allocated to each process, or even the total amount allocated.

when i've used my mac for 5 minutes 95% of my 3 gb ram is used, and it will stay that way, it never goes down. that's just the way the os handles memory.

8,63,"maybe. but you have bigger problems. gettimeofday() can result in incorrect timings if there are processes on your system that change the timer (ie, ntpd). on a ""normal"" linux, though, i believe the resolution of gettimeofday() is 10us. it can jump forward and backward and time, consequently, based on the processes running on your system. this effectively makes the answer to your question no.

you should look into clock_gettime(clock_monotonic) for timing intervals. it suffers from several less issues due to things like multi-core systems and external clock settings.

for a web application where i'll have a single production database instance, i use two techniques:

database upgrade scripts

a sequence database upgrade scripts that contain the ddl necessary to move the schema from version n to n+1.  (these go in your version control system.)  a _version_history_ table, something like

create table versionhistory (
    version int primary key,
    upgradestart datetime not null,
    upgradeend datetime
    );


gets a new entry every time an upgrade script runs which corresponds to the new version.

this ensures that it's easy to see what version of the database schema exists and that database upgrade scripts are run only once.  again, these are not database dumps.  rather, each script represents the changes necessary to move from one version to the next.  they're the script that you apply to your production database to ""upgrade"" it.

developer sandbox synchronization


a script to backup, sanitize, and shrink a production database.  run this after each upgrade to the production db.
a script to restore (and tweak, if necessary) the backup on a developer's workstation.  each developer runs this script after each upgrade to the production db.


a caveat: my automated tests run against a schema-correct but empty database, so this advice will not perfectly suit your needs.

curs.execute('select * from people')
for row in curs:
    print row




you can use fetchall() to get all rows at once.

for row in curs.fetchall():
    print row


it can be convenient to use this to create a python list containing the values returned:

curs.execute('select first_name from people')
names = [row[0] for row in curs.fetchall()]


this can be useful for smaller result sets, but can have bad side effects if the result set is large.


you have to wait for the entire result set to be returned to
your client process.
you may eat up a lot of memory in your client to hold
the built-up list.
it may take a while for python to construct and deconstruct the
list which you are going to immediately discard anyways.




if you know there's a single row being returned in the result set you can call fetchone() to get the single row.

curs.execute('select max(x) from t')
maxvalue = curs.fetchone()[0]




finally, you can loop over the result set fetching one row at a time.  in general, there's no particular advantage in doing this over using the iterator.

there are a lot of overloads for passing parameters to the constructor and such. check out the documentation at:

32,840,"important note: you have to sort your data first.

the part i didn't get is that in the example construction
groups = []
uniquekeys = []
for k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):
   groups.append(list(g))    # store group iterator as a list
   uniquekeys.append(k)

k is the current grouping key, and g is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key. in other words, the groupby iterator itself returns iterators.
here's an example of that, using clearer variable names:
from itertools import groupby

things = [(""animal"", ""bear""), (""animal"", ""duck""), (""plant"", ""cactus""), (""vehicle"", ""speed boat""), (""vehicle"", ""school bus"")]

for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    for thing in group:
        print(""a %s is a %s."" % (thing[1], key))
    print("""")
    

this will give you the output:

a bear is a animal.
a duck is a animal.
a cactus is a plant.
a speed boat is a vehicle.
a school bus is a vehicle.

in this example, things is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to.
the groupby() function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with.
here, lambda x: x[0] tells groupby() to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.
in the above for statement, groupby returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key. you can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.
here's a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:
for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    listofthings = "" and "".join([thing[1] for thing in group])
    print(key + ""s:  "" + listofthings + ""."")

this will give you the output:

animals: bear and duck.
plants: cactus.
vehicles: speed boat and school bus.
